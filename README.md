# Oncology_Ontology_DGE file in R
File is written for the visual format of R using an R markdown file. Please launch in RStudio. 

Ontology workshop originally intended for James Madison University BIO477/577: Genetics of Cancer.

All data required is included in the R HTML file and is accumulated via the recount3 package. Recount3 can not work on the cloud-based version of R and needs access to the command line to work. 

Windows users need Rtools >V4.5 installed prior to downloading or parsing any Bioconductor packages. 

All packages are listed in an associated Google Doc linked within the file.
